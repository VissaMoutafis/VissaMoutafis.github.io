I am a PhD Student at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/cybersecurity/people/vissarion-moutafis) in Systems Security, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Alexios Voulimeneas and Professor Georgios Smaragdakis, since May 2025. My research interests extend but not limited to Dynamic Analysis, Fuzzing, System-Call Interpositioning and all things systems.

I hold a BSc in Informatics and Telecommunications from the University of Athens and an MSc in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity from TU Delft. I have industry experience in CENSUS SA, Greece as a Security Intern and Security Engineer.
