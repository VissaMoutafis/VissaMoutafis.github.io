  abstract = {System call interposition is a widely used technique to trace and modify application behavior. Over the years, numerous interposition mechanisms have been proposed, each with distinct strengths and trade-offs. Recently, advances in binary rewriting---specifically targeting x86-64 syscall and sysenter instructions---have led to new techniques that take important steps forward, with some claiming to support general-purpose use.},
